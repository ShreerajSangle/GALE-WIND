This project explores the application of **deep learning** for early cyclone detection using **satellite imagery**. 
By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the model automatically extracts relevant features, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering, 
a limitation of traditional methods. 
The CNN is trained on a large dataset containing both cyclone and non-cyclone images, enabling it to learn distinguishing cyclone characteristics. 
The project focuses on improving **accuracy** and **generalizability**, 
allowing the model to detect cyclones across varying weather conditions while maintaining a balance between **precision** and **recall**. 
By minimizing **false positives** and **false negatives**, 
the model ensures reliable cyclone identification. 
The CNN architecture is designed for efficient **image classification**, 
and strategies to address computational challenges, such as optimizing the model and using cloud resources for **parallel processing**, 
are explored. Ultimately, the goal is to develop a robust CNN model that can be integrated into real-world **cyclone monitoring systems** for early warnings, 
improving disaster preparedness and response.
